“Alexa, terminate all my untagged instances.”  Imagine being able to do common AWS administrative tasks just by using your voice. At a recent Utah-AWS Meetup we demonstrated how, in a matter of a few minutes, you could be automating your own AWS Administration tasks using an Amazon Echo and AWS. The goal of this post is to show you how easy it is to use AWS Lambda to create new Alexa skills. We’ll walk you through the creation of a Lambda function, creating all the resources necessary for an Alexa skill, and finally how to deploy and test it on your own Amazon Echo.
